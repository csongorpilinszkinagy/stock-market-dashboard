# Stock Market Dashboard

## Features

- [ ] Real-Time Data Fetching
  - [ ] Use APIs (like Alpha Vantage, IEX Cloud, or Yahoo Finance) to fetch real-time stock market data.
  - [ ] Implement data caching and error handling to manage API rate limits and downtime.
- [ ] Data Processing and Analysis
  - [ ] Preprocess and clean the data (handling missing values, normalization).
  - [ ] Apply statistical techniques to analyze trends and patterns (e.g., moving averages, Bollinger Bands).
  - [ ] Use machine learning algorithms to predict stock prices or detect anomalies (e.g., time series forecasting, clustering).
- [ ] Optimization
  - [ ] Ensure efficient data processing by using appropriate data structures and algorithms.
  - [ ] Implement parallel processing or asynchronous operations to handle data fetching and analysis.
- [ ] Visualization
  - [ ] Develop an interactive dashboard using libraries like Plotly, Dash, or Bokeh.
  - [ ] Provide real-time updates and visualizations of stock prices, trends, and predictions.
  - [ ] Allow users to filter and explore data (e.g., by stock symbol, date range).
- [ ] Deployment
  - [ ] Deploy the application on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku) for accessibility.
  - [ ] Ensure scalability to handle increasing data and user load.
- [ ] Testing and Documentation
  - [ ] Write comprehensive unit tests and integration tests for your code.
  - [ ] Document the project thoroughly, including setup instructions, code comments, and usage examples.
- [ ] Additional Challenges
  - [ ] Performance Optimization: Analyze and improve the performance of data fetching, processing, and visualization.
  - [ ] Security: Implement security measures to protect sensitive data and user information.
  - [ ] User Experience: Design a user-friendly interface that makes the application easy to use and navigate.
